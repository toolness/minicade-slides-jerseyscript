This is a [reveal.js][]-based slideshow about [Minicade][] made for
[JerseyScript][]'s July 2014 meetup.

The files in this repository were taken directly from the reveal.js ZIP
file, so there may be some extraneous stuff in here. Just open
`index.html` in a browser and you should be good to go.

The Dumb Ways To Die kidney and associated animation code was lifted from
[dumbwaystodie.com][] without their permission. Hope that's okay!
